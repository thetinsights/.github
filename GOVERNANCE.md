## ✅ Becoming a Contributor

Anyone can become a contributor! Start by:

- Opening issues
- Submitting pull requests
- Giving feedback on discussions

We recognize all contributors via the [All Contributors](https://allcontributors.org) standard.

---

## 🛠️ Becoming a Maintainer

A contributor may be invited to become a **maintainer** by the Core Team based on:

- Sustained participation
- High-quality contributions
- Demonstrated collaboration and maturity

**Expectations of maintainers:**

- Review PRs and issues regularly
- Uphold the code of conduct
- Collaborate respectfully

---

## 🧭 Core Team

The **Core Team** governs major project decisions, roadmaps, and long-term vision. Members are added by consensus of existing Core Team members.

They are responsible for:

- Defining project scope and direction
- Resolving escalated issues or conflicts
- Approving large-scale architectural or organizational changes

## 🔄 Decision-Making Process

| Type of Decision        | Who Decides             | How It’s Decided             |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Minor changes / patches | Maintainers             | Simple majority / consensus  |
| New features            | Maintainers + Core Team | PR review + feedback process |
| Breaking changes        | Core Team               | Consensus or majority vote   |
| Governance updates      | Core Team + Community   | Proposal → feedback → merge  |

## 🧩 Conflict Resolution

Conflicts should be resolved respectfully and privately first. If unresolved:

1. Escalate to a **maintainer**
2. Then to the **Core Team**
3. Final decision rests with the **Governance Lead**

---

## 🔒 Transparency

All decisions and discussions should happen publicly in issues or discussions unless sensitive (e.g., security).

---

## 📜 Amendments

This document may be updated by the Core Team with input from the community. Major changes will be proposed and discussed publicly.
